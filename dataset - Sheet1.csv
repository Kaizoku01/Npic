04-11-2021,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Himy name is XXXX XXXX. I have been married for 30 years ( this past XXXX ) and my awesome Wife and I have XXXX amazing children. 

We have been in our current home for 21 years and we have raised all of our children in it. XXXX of our children were actually XXXX in this home. 

My Wife and I have experienced many financial setbacks due to COVID-19. The XXXX that I was a XXXX of closed its doors due to Covid and the XXXX position that my Wife enjoyed ended due to the death of her client, both in XXXX of XXXX. My Wife, XXXX of our children and I also had XXXX in XXXX and were down for the count for about a month in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Like a lot of other families, it has been very challenging to keep a sense of security for our children. 

My Wife and I are both now gainfully employed, and are playing catch up in life. We love our home and are really trying to keep our family in it. 

Our mortgage servicer, Select Portfolio Serving Inc. has grossly mishandled our situation, in our opinion. 

In XXXX of XXXX we reached out to said mortgage service provider ( SPS ) and explained our plight. We asked for a mortgage modification to lower our payment so that we could afford to stay in our home. On XX/XX/XXXX they came back with ONE option, a Repayment Plan which consisted of making new payments of {$4500.00}. I immediately called them to explain that we could not possibly afford these new payments especially when we could not make our regular sized payments of {$2200.00}. 
The wonderful representative, XXXX, suggested that we file an Appeal to ask them to spread the repayment plan over 36 months to lower the payments to {$1500.00} per month. She was kind enough to walk me thru the exact steps on where to go on there website and exactly what to say. This was a real blessing to us to get this great advice. Upon the conclusion of my call with XXXX, I immediately followed her steps to file an appeal and wrote it exactly as she had suggested, verbatim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, SPS acknowledged that they had received my appeal. I assumed they were considering it and my family and I waited for their response. There was no response. 

In the past, I had been told that my point of contact, the gentleman that is in charge of our situation, is a rep named XXXX XXXX. I left Mr. XXXX eight detailed voicemails as to our ongoing situation and asked if he would please contact us as soon as possible so we knew what to do. We lived in constant fear that the XXXX Sheriff would be pulling up to the house to serve us foreclosure papers. I was an extremely difficult period of uncertainty. 

I continued to keep checking our appeal status on the SPS website every other day and it continually said it was being Processed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX again and opted out of the dial your reps extension now and I spoke to a rep named XXXX. 
She acknowledged that they had indeed received my appeal, and they they indeed had NOT responded. She told me that they do NOT respond to appeals on Repayment Programs, ever. I told her how I had spoken with the rep named XXXX, and that XXXX was the one that suggested that I file an appeal, told me exactly what to say and guided me right thru the process on their website. 

XXXX, the rep that told me they Never negotiate repayment plans said that our new payment is {$4500.00}, it is NON NEGOTIABLE and that our first payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We are at our wits end and very fearful of looming news that we will be in foreclosure. 

Could you please help us keep our home? 
We are really trying to make this right and stay in our home of 21 years. 

Thank you in advance, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",FL,34240,,Consent provided,Web,04-11-2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,1657007
16-03-2022,Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Hello! 

XXXX XXXX has been trying to collect a debt from me fraudulently for almost 18 months now. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX In 2020 I was issued a XXXX machine for medical treatment on an insurance payment plan that required compliance with the treatment in order for insurance to continue to pay. I agreed to this plan. I remained compliant for the ENTIRE payment period and treatment plan however they claim I have not remained compliant because their system has no records for my XXXX machine ( which I believe wirelessly uploads data cellularly ). As a result they have been trying to charge me {$210.00} since XX/XX/2020. 

The specific amounts owed are : {$100.00} for non-compliance in XXXX of 2020 {$100.00} for non-compliance in XXXX of 2020 I have attached proof of my compliance AND my communications with the previous debt collector. 

I have called XXXX a half dozen times about these invalid charges, and 2 different times faxed them proof of my treatment compliance from my local XXXX store. They continue to claim they've never received proof of compliance and thus continue to attempt to collect. 

Eventually I was sent to collections and I sent them also proof of my compliance ( also attached ). This debt collector stopped contacted me and I assumed it was fixed. Today I received a new debt collection request from a new debt collector, so the issue isn't stopping. The new debt collector is ARStrat ( XXXX ). 

I would like your help stopping their fraudulent claims please! I do not owe them any money and would appreciate your help proving this fact.",,Patient Accounting Service Center,FL,32207,,Consent provided,Web,16-03-2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5069898

I said "" yes '' - and requested an additional card for my daughter ( to use in case of emergency ). I received the cards then my daughter comes to me shortly thereafter and said that her credit score dropped almost XXXX points due to this Chase credit card. I was not sure how this could happen, as they did not have her permission, nor her social security number. I called Chase. They were not helpful and just said that it 's part of their process and it 's on their website that any other user 's information will be used. So I went back to the website and printed off the documentation - and did NOT find such info. Chase also put me through to the credit bureau they use ( I do n't recall which but seems maybe like XXXX ). I asked how they obtained my daughter 's permission and SS number to run her credit. They proceeded to tell me that they matched her name with my address and located her information in their database. Needless to say, this appears to be a privacy issue, at the very least. My daughter is trying to buy a home in the next year, and this does not help her FICO score! With Chase nor the credit bureau willing to help, I feel my only option is to file this complaint with your agency.

They still cancelled the re-fi and told me they could not see the notes the care agent entered. I told them this was not fair and that it is not my fault they have a technology problem.

I called and was told there was "" a mistake and some ... a few customers were mistakingly reported to the Credit Bureaus but they would issue a retraction ''. Mine was corrected, my wife 's however was not. Ive called several times on this matter and either their computers are down or something. I called this morning XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to try to get this taken care of. The customer service rep puts me on hold then comes back a few minutes later to tell me I will have to pull a copy of my wife 's credit report from one of the 3 bureaus and then fax or mail it in. I asked why I would have to do that now when I did n't have to do that before? She said she was n't sure but if I wanted it fixed thats what I would have to do. I said no I should n't have to spend my own money to fix a mistake your company made. And then I asked to speak to someone in that investigation department. She said she is that department. I asked why when I called the other day I was on hold to be transferred but their computers were down? ... she said that I called a different department, I said no it was customer service. So now customer service is the investigation department I guess. I should not have to go through this much trouble to fix a mistake on their part. I do believe they are discriminating against me as I filed a complaint on them before for their terrible customer service and mishandling of my mortgage and this is how they retaliate. I also just this past week opted out of a mortgage modification with them after they told me I would not be able to make my XXXX payment and would have to wait till XXXX to make my first payment. I said XXXX no I am not going to be late on my mortgage and go through all this again. The rep told me well thats how this works, you have to be behind if there is a hardship. I told them to cancel the modification I opt out. Today since my account was just unlocked to make my payment before the XXXX, I find another {$20.00} fee accessed to my payment. When I asked the above first mentioned rep she said it is a Property Preservation Fee that was made to the account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I said no my mortgage has been current as of XXXX and I will dispute any other fees as you guys already charged me two {$20.00} fees ( FEMA Natural Disaster Billed Fee ) while under the forbearance. 

The former complaint I filed was closed after the mortgage company sent in a bunch of misinformation and out right lies regarding contacts, dates, etc, to which I never got the opportunity to rebuttal.

Customer Service at Flagstar let me know that it was being handled as a bad debt and that it would be processed and refunded to us. This started in XX/XX/2019 and is still continuing. Just to add some spice to this whole thing, we sold our house on XX/XX/2019 and had to pay the shortfall in our escrow. The customer service rep I have been working with approached them again and now they are saying the loan is paid off so we see this as finished. I will tell you that this particular agent is working with 5 other customers with the same problem and no accountability from Flagstar.

It is Nissans own fault that this payment is being reported late, and they refuse to take any responsibility for it. I was given a COVID-19 extension, and this negative reporting could have been avoided because Nissan could have received the signed extension form back before the payment due date ( XXXX XXXX ) if they had given me accurate information when I inquired about an extension in midXXXXXXXX XXXX. They told me that the extension form had to be mailed, and it could not be emailed or faxed to me. I never received the extension form from Nissan in the mail. So, I contacted Nissan again, and the representative emailed the form to me immediately. 

He told me the form could not be emailed back, it had to be faxed. But when I received the form in the email, it listed an email address for the form to be sent back to. I returned the signed form, and the extension was granted. Therefore, the payment that was extended should Not have been reported late. The extension was already in the works, and it was just tacked on to the end of the loan. When you look at the before and after extension screen-prints I have, you can see that the Past Due amount changed to ZERO after the extension was granted/applied. 

I have the Extension Form. and this is all the documentation that I have since I can not show the telephone conversation where your representative misled me and said he could not fax or email the extension form to me ( which would have saved a lot of time and avoided this problem ), but it had to be mailed. 

So you can see that this 30-Day late payment was not due to any fault of mine. If NISSAN would have just told me that with the extension, they were going to flagged it as a late payment, I would have borrowed the money and made the payment on time. I told this to one of your online chat representatives and he said he would note this on the account.

I asked them very specifically if this has the special promotion. And they very clearly confirmed it was. I even have a screen shot of the message that confirmed it. I then proceeded to spend way more then {$1500.00} over the next 90 days and met the requirements. 

In early XXXX I reached out to AMEX to inquire when the statement credit would be made. They told me I supposedly never signed up under the proper promotion page. I asked for escalation and talked to a dozen other representatives over the next 3 months via message and phone. After all this they again reiterated I would not be paid the promotion as I did not sign up properly. 

The worst part of the matter is AMEX customer service .They had me re-explain the situation every time and made it very difficult and time consuming to advance the issue. I asked to have a case opened and for the ticket or case number for future followup - they told me they did not give out such information to customers. I asked for an email confirmation for my case - again they said the did not have such a mechanism. I asked where can I submit my evidence ( screenshot mentioned earlier ) - they led me to an arcane system that made me have to jump through hoops to offer it. I asked to get an email on how my case was proceeding - they told me only the only recourse was their online message which purposely does not allow for message trails. I very much hope that this issue is investigated and that my many phone calls or texts were recorded so everyone can see the arcane system I had to go through. 

All in all, it seems like the entire AMEX customer inquiry process is designed to force a consumer to go through a byzantine system in the hope that the consumer will give up before the case can be properly evaluated. AMEX seems to deliberately not allow for case tracking, followup, or basic notifications on the consumer side. I wasted a huge amount of time working my way through this poorly designed system ( or purposely designed with the intention of creating a labyrinth for the consumer ) This promotion is repeatedly offered and open to everyone. No sensible person in my situation would sign up for the non-bonus route when a good bonus route is easily available. I would like to add Ive only ever signed up for XXXX other AMEX bonus ever in my lifetime ( via the XXXX XXXX ) This is not something I do often. 

I am quite simply appalled at AMEX 's dangerous practices and how they conduct themselves. Besides not getting what I duly earned, I am more concerned about the process which it seems to me, obviously and deliberately gives favor over AMEX at the expense of normal consumers.

22-03-2022,Personal consumer reports,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,I had amazing credit until recently when XXXX reported that I was past due on my payment some time in XX/XX/XXXX '. When I received an alert saying my credit score had dropped I was dumbfounded to learn that my car loan company was claiming I had not made a payment in two months. Upon checking my account through their app I learned my scheduled payments were no longer being applied for reasons even they could not explain so in XX/XX/XXXX ' I promptly brought my account current and while disappoint it had negatively impacted my credit score I assumed responsibility and made sure my correct card info was there and that I'd get alerts should parents not post going forward. Well it happened again for XXXX. To summarize I'm paying my car note from the same account I've been paying from for the last year and despite the funds being fully available and them confirming per their app payment was posted only for several days later to be returned unpayed without any notice or attempts at contacting me either by phone or even an automated alert to which I'm signed up for leaving me to not see this until I am paying the following month. When I contacted XXXX to gain insight on the matter ( sidenote : I had also been having concerns due to the fact I'd been receiving notices someone accessed my account with my login info when I had not logged in myself ) the representative admitted they had been having issues with alerts and could not give me a reason why they were not sending any email or calls about it and that I'd have to dispute the late payment reported on credit. Well I did dispute the first one and didn't get a clear reason why it hadn't been removed. I'm currently trying to buy my first house and obviously this should be detrimental to the ability to qualify for a loan to do so which has already been a struggle for other reason I'm dispute on another claim. It's clear from my bank statement the funds were available to make the payments and recording from XXXX acknowledging them being unsure why it didn't go through either and the representative inability to remove the late payment status as well.,,MOUNTAIN AMERICA FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NM,87108,,Consent provided,Web,22-03-2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3531009

For example, I signed up via their app to transfer $ XXXX at 0 % APR and paid XXXX transfer fee. Well I had purchases on the card like anyone would with XXXX that month. Since I had auto pays after the transfer processed they took my {$1300.00} payment and applied it to everything but that balance of the XXXX charging 23.99 % interest and you literally now can not pay it off unless you pay everything including that transfer off. Their disclosure is deceptive as well that they sent. It does not specify your balance transfer that you're making would have to be paid in full which literally cancels out your purpose and nobody would do it if that was clearly written and not a bait and switch tactic/deceptive practice. It removes your right to use your card as agreed upon after a balance transfer until it processes which is in their complete control which to me is a fraudulent practice. So now, I am out of the balance transfer amount, the amount they charge in a fee 5 % and any interest on the those amount from the previous statement that they refuse to appropriately apply the payments to.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,75089,,Consent provided,Web,21-09-2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5111703

Per CFPB guidelines and Regulation X, a servicer has 30 days to decision a loss mitigation option. Fay Servicing violated Regulation X by not decisioning my loss mitigation option. 

In addition, in an attempt to state I did not submit a complete package, Fay Servicing requested the same information that was already provided to XXXX ( Prior servicer ) and continued to delay the loss mitigation review process. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXX that Fay Servicing sent the file to their investor for a decision, which was over 2 months after I submitted a completed package. 

Fay Servicing stated their investor responded to the current offer on XX/XX/XXXX which is over 3 months after my loss mitigation package was submitted and a clear violation of Regulation X. 

The investor stated they wanted a {$100000.00} NET in order to approve the short sale. The buyer was countered to meet this requirement. Despite Fay Servicing being out of regulation, it was my intention to sell this property and avoid foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX, Fay Servicing issued a short sale approval letter, but only good through XX/XX/XXXX only 23 days were allowed for the buyer to get financing, prepare title, and schedule a closing date. Please keep in mind that I am trying to avoid a foreclosure on my credit and work with the Servicer for a graceful exit. I also had XXXX which did not help either. 

The buyers and Title company went right to work but had to wait 21 days to obtain tax certificates in Pennsylvania. This is completely out of my control and is unusually delayed due to local Covid-19 protocols. In addition to that delay, the Township requires a certificate on the property in order for the buyer to proceed with a sale. Another short delay, and due to covid pandemic, the inspection process on behalf of the Township took longer than expected. We immediately informed Fay Servicing that we needed a few extra days to close and fund this transaction. We inquired if we needed to push out the closing on XX/XX/XXXX and one Fay Servicing negotiator, in writing, advised us not cancel the closing. This seemed positive that we were going to obtain the short sale extension letter for closing and avoid foreclosure. 

However, a second Fay Servicing employee stated that Fay Servicing would not honor an extension letter from the original approval they provided due to the delay. They are forcing me into a foreclosure for the benefit of their investors profits. Giving me 23 days to prepare for a closing is an unreasonable amount of time, and I let them know about this. They refused to work with me as profit over outcome is more important to them and their investor. They are now asking for more money to close stating I did not meet the closing requirements which were almost impossible to meet due to restrictions out of my control. 

Fay servicing and the investor denied a valid request for a short sale extension and believe a foreclosure is a better outcome. These servicing practices are simply unethical and unreasonable. They are not trying to help consumers but forcefully strong arming consumers and forcing foreclosure. 

It is obvious that Fay Servicing has a lack of operational controls on their short sale timelines. A traditional short sale approval letter is typically valid for 30 days. Why did we have 23 days to close when other consumers are allowed 30 days to close. If we had 30 days to close, we would have closed and funded with no issues. Unfortunately, Fay Servicing and the investor of my loan, XXXX XXXX XXXX, are forcing consumers into foreclosure. These unethical servicing practices must stop. They have already been fined by the CFPB in the past and they continue with the same practices.",,"Fay Servicing, LLC",PA,19061,,Consent provided,Web,20-05-2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,1346775

XXXX XXXX | Mortgage Specialist, XXXX TD Bank, XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX I was told to go to XXXX and check my credit score. My credit score is XXXX. 

I wanted to know how to qualify for a $ XXXX loan. I was told I needed a XXXX score. 
She verbally asked me how much I was making and she said that it was enough. 

I have been at my job for 7 years and my income is steady. 
I wanted to be certain because the year prior to this I had an injury that prevented me from performing my usual tasks. My income was effected and low for that year. 

I asked my specialist if I could email my taxes and was told that she does not accept taxes through email. I was surprised to hear it and thought it was an unusual professional practice. 

I paid for my own credit report because TD Bank deemed XXXX as a creditable site to gauge my qualifications. 
The bank says now that my credit report is XXXX or lower and that XXXX is inaccurate. 

If only I was told to get a free credit report from XXXX I could have received a free copy of my credit report and, I would not have received a HARD INQUIRY on my record! 

I was denied the loan. Then my specialist asks me for my taxes. She said the underwriter wanted to see them. 

TD Bank then sends me a conditional approval letter for 50 % less than the amount I inquired for. 

I told my specialist that I was not interested this counter-offer procedure and then was told I had been denied for this as well. 

Asking for two years of income taxes is not an uncommon thing. 
When something uncommon does occur such as an injury, a Good banking practice would be to request further proof of income. TD Bank is apparently only interested in two years of taxable income only. 

I could have supplied an actually credit report and tax information if interested in lower loan amounts! In fact, if I was able to give this information in the beginning I would have found out that I should go to a different bank. 

Hard inquiries are not good for the consumer and, TD Bank mortgage specialist did not take this into account. It was really inconsiderate. She was taking guesses with my credit and income. 

This branch of TD Bank is now refusing to provide me with a copy of the credit report I paid for. I am being told to go get my own. 
I thought it was a professional courtesy to provide the customer with a copy of their credit report. I paid for it, I own it. 

I only get one free copy of my credit report a year and this is without a hard inquiry. This inconsiderate branch bank, is telling me to use my yearly free copy to confirm what this bank is verbally saying. That I am denied. 

This branch of TD Bank emailed me saying that the thirty point discrepancy on XXXX was not a determining factor in my denial because they offered me a different cash-out refi product. That even if my credit was above 700, they still could not approve me because my income for XXXX is too low. It makes no sense at all, and I feel they are purposefully just wasting my time because they have no incentive. 

A credit report is reusable up to 30 days. I believe this branch is trying to prevent me from bringing my credit report to a different bank for a better rate. 
Maybe a bank that will look at my work income history for longer than two years. 

I was not informed that I would not be able to get a copy of my purchased report. I believe I was bated into seeing an inflated credit rating on the internet in order to be offered any lower loan amount. Running a persons credit without any income verification is amateur.

18-01-2018,Prepaid card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a pair of XXXX audio headphones. After using them, I was n't satisfied with some of the features such as sound quality and noise cancellation. On XX/XX/XXXX, well within the 30-day return period, I proceeded to the store to return the item. I was then told I was not allowed to return the headphones. When I inquired as to why, I was told that I had made "" too many returns '' and could not return merchandise for 1 year. I was given a slip with the name of the third-party vendor that BestBuy utilizes to monitor return activity. Nowhere is such information listed on their receipt, or in the store. The merchandise was functional and completely returned in the original packaging. When working with the BestBuy Executive Resolution Specialist, follow up was by coincidence slow to intentionally ensure if I were able to return the item, I would miss the 30-day window. After demanding an update, XXXX informed me that she was unable to lift the blackout of returns and offered me a {$100.00}. At that time, I advised how disgusted I was with the treatment and felt that since this was the best customer service I could get, I 'd take the gift card. HOWEVER, XXXX, denied my acceptance of the offer, and instead informed that XXXX XXXX XXXX that I declined. Per the documentation, that is an outright fabrication. This return policy is deceptive. We as consumers do n't have any idea that our purchases and returns are even being monitored. Let alone, that we only have limited capability to truly determine if we 're satisfied with the purchase. This policy is well hidden and extremely convoluted leaving a consumer to feel as if they do n't have rights. This is an unfair and deceptive business practice employed by BestBuy. First, as an Elite member, we are given 60 days to make returns based on the volume of purchases. Secondly, as a BestBuy credit cardholder or Elite Member, they NEVER disclose that they track purchases based on your e-mail or account information to limit the amount of returns you can make. So while BestBuy has their "" general '' return policy posted in stores, what they do n't advertise is that they have two separate return policies in place that greatly limits the consumer ability to fairly choose whether a product is right for them. Therefore, I demand that Best Buy honor their offer of providing a gift card, as well as lift the "" blackout '' of no returns from my account immediately.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MI,48101,,Consent provided,Web,24-01-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,,1453464

I was then told to send in IRS form F4506 and my husband 's bank statements showing deposits from work that he'd done. We resubmitted the requested information on XX/XX/XXXX. I called a month later on XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed the loss mitigation case was closed because they needed my husband 's paystubs. I explained to the agent again that my husband is self employed and there is no way to get a paystub and there is absolutely no mention of paystubs for self employed people on their list of documents. My husband also called on that day and spoke with an agent who told them that the package should have never been closed and it was going to be reopened he was told to send over his bank statements and a signed F4506 by XX/XX/2022.

09-10-2018,Debt collection,Communication tactics,"Used obscene, profane, or other abusive language","On XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to Clark County Collections agency in order to see what I can do to correct a medical debt they aquired. I spoke with XXXX telephone number XXXX and I was very patient with her, but she continued to be vague with her answers. Specifically I asked her if I could get a copy of the medical debt because I don't remember going to emergency that day. She told me that it would take 30 days to get the information, which is fine. The problem I have is how her tone changed when I asked her, about how long I would have as it relates to moving forward with the judgement. She said I need to refer to my paperwork, however, my paperwork has XX/XX/XXXX, but they served my neighbor the documents on XX/XX/XXXX, while they were taking out the trash before going out of town. I had to advise her that she's not clear and I need to know if I have time to wait on these documents, and eventually she gave an answer, but her tone is rude. Mean while I'm trying to reach out to all parties involved. I call XXXX again XX/XX/XXXX, to advise that I can work out some arrangements, but I'm the only income in my house. She has no compassion, I ask to speak with a manager. She gets me to XXXX telephone number XXXX and I'm trying to work out arrangements or a settlement with her. I asked XXXX how long do I have to decide what I'm going to do, and she as the supervisor gives me a vague answer. At this point I'm really frustrated and I need to know how long before they move forward with the judgement, and her tone changes, as she states you need to refer back to your paperwork because she doesn't have it in front of her. I disregard her tone at this time, and address the fact that my paperwork says XX/XX/XXXX, however my neighbor was given this information on XX/XX/XXXX, so I don't have a clear timeframe because I have two different dates. As I told XXXX about the situation of my neighbor being served and not me, she entertains the conversation. I explain to her how I know it happened, but I'm not clear because, the paperwork was given to my neighbor, handed to my husband and then given to me. She said that she doesn't know the person is but they use XXXX, and then asked me is there anything else she can help me with, in rude tone. When I ask her for the number, she displays a more irritable tone. The call at this time goes south, where she's talking over me and she's refusing to assist me because all she wants is the money. I'm a customer and there is no reason that u shouldn't be treated as if I'm an XXXX, and they would feel the same way if they were in my shoes. As a consumer I have a right to ask questions about my account, and get a clear understanding and the treatment they gave me was unfair.

16-03-2021,Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was already discharged in bankruptcy and is no longer owed,"On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a Ch XXXX in the State of Wisconsin Bankruptcy Court docket number XXXX. Presiding over that hearing, was XXXX XXXX Ch XXXX Trustee. Included in that filing were several medical bills from XXXX held in collections by NAS National Account Systems of Madison WI XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX, WI XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

Approx 3 months after the bankruptcy hearing, NAS removed all collections as active citing them under the bankruptcy. In XXXX, NAS re-aged those same medical bills, gave them new acct numbers and re-listed them as ACTIVE and reported them to the Credit agencies. I then called NAS and they removed them a second time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, NAS AGAIN re-aged these same medical bills gave them new dates, acct numbers and re-listed them as active collections to the credit agencies. This resulted in my score dropping 44 points as of XX/XX/XXXX which is how I found out NAS had done this again to me. I have worked very hard over the past two years to rebuild my credit after filing the initial bankruptcy in XXXX and it was just reaching the XXXX score prior to NAS illegally doing this again with these discharged debts.

I contacted NAS on XX/XX/XXXX, left a nasty expletive laden voice mail to them, called my bankruptcy attorney and contacted the Hearing Officer, XXXX XXXX. I then disputed these debts as active collections with the Credit Agencies and now I am contacting you for investigation and sanctions to be levied against them ( NAS ).

The first time they re-aged a re-listed these post bankruptcy, I bought their excuse it was a "" mistake ''. I let it go. However it is less than one year later after that and they have done it again. They did not call me at anytime for that would have alerted me that they were seeking to collect and they knew that these were discharged through that XXXX bankruptcy. NAS decided to again go behind the scene and place them for collections with the credit agencies. Prior to filing the bankruptcy this agency ( NAS ) hounded me constantly vis telephone for payment. post Bankruptcy this agency did call me ONCE asking for payment but instead, just re-listed them as active to the credit agencies. Now that, is BS and can in no way be construed as a simple mistake or error on their end the second time around.

Since they have violated the bankruptcy laws of WI as well as caused adverse action o t be taken against my credit score, I am seeking damages- punitive as well. I gave them the benefit of the doubt post bankruptcy the first time they re-listed these as active in XXXX. I am not giving them the benefit of the doubt this time or, letting them get away with this, this time.",,"National Account Systems of Madison, Inc",WI,53705,,Consent provided,Web,23-03-2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5272446

31-07-2017,Debt collection,Communication tactics,"You told them to stop contacting you, but they keep trying","American Education Services aka PHEAA has been consistently harassing my co-signer and me even after making payments to resolve the delinquencies that occurred on and off throughout the course of the loan payment process. I 've spoken with a number of representatives at AES who claim it 's their legal obligation to continue with letters and phone calls until the account is current, in addition to calling and sending letters after the account is current. I also call them whenever I will be late with a payment letting them know when a payment will be made, however they state that calls and letters will still take place. This is a direct violation of my consumer rights as a citizen. This is severe harassment. If I was late with payments, they never fell delinquent past 30 days. In the event that you are calling to make arrangements, that should immediately indemnify any communication unless that payment arrangement becomes null and void as of the scheduled date the payment is set up to be made or thereafter. If communication continues again in the event that a loan is late by only a matter of days, I will be filing a complaint with the district attorney in addition to hiring my own attorney to investigate the constant harassment throughout AES/PHEAA. Keep in mind, that it 's absolutely fraudulent to send a co-signer a notice asking for a payment after a payment was already made. That is an attempt to collect money for something that was already collected. Here are a few testimonials I 've found which go into fair details about the immoral activity that takes place at AES/PHEAA : 1. When I first started paying on my student loans I assumed payments were being applied as directed ; I was completely wrong! Please make sure you check on any payment you send to your student loan. I have tried to send an extra payment on a monthly basis to try to pay off my debt, and after countless calls and speaking to managers I have come to accept I have to check on my loan minimum twice a month. The problems have ranged from my extra payments not being applied AT ALL ( in which case I have to send bank statements and copy of check ) to my account being placed on "" Paid Ahead '' status as it continues to accumulate interest. If you check the website, it states you can target specific loans online, which is completely false. Every manager I speak to gives me a different reason for my payment being applied as they see fit, versus how I am asking for my payment to be applied. Reasons range from putting a cap on how much you can pay towards a subsidized loan to a letter being mailed with the check with "" EXACTWORDING. '' In one of my previous calls, I had to have the manager dictate the letter I needed to write, which I send out with my check on a monthly basis. Of course this has done nothing to the way my payment is applied, as now they tell me letters are thrown away once thecheck is received and the person receiving the check is not the one to apply the payment. 
Now, along with the letter stapled to the check, I have to write 3 things on the memo field of the 
check, "" DO NOT PLACE MY ACCOUNT ON PAID AHEAD STATUS '', the loan number I want to target, and my account number. You would assume with all this information I would not have a problem ; however, you are wrong again! My payment is still not applied to the account stated, Ihave to spend a minimum of 15 minutes on the phone verifying all my contact information and getting pass the automated service explaining how I have to call EVERY single month, and I have to wait 7-10 business days before my payment is reapplied. In some cases, this does not happen and I need to call again, in others, I have to submit yet another letter asking them to reapply my payment. I sure wish I had looked at my loans closely for the first 5 years of payments ; or that I had the money to pay them off once and for all! 2.
I have received 6 letters in the mail, and an email claiming and I owe them money for my graduate school loan. All my loans are with XXXX, and they have no record of transferring any of my accounts to another lender. The department of education also has no record of me having any loans with them. What they are doing is fraud and harassment. 3. I borrowed $ XXXX in student loans, which were sold/consolidated with AES. This was the biggest mistake of my life. I would have been better off with a loan shark. I have paid over $ 28K in loan payments but still owe $ XXXX. That means $ XXXX went toward principal and $ XXXX went to interest and fees. I have tried get assistance with to no avail. Their only response is to pay more than my scheduled payment. 4. I received a letter that I was going into default. I called and explained I had recently gone through a separation and was a struggling single parent of XXXX. I could n't afford my regular day to day bills and could n't afford the payment. I was told that I could do a voluntary arrangement on top of the 15 % garnishment that was being sent to my employer. Well I worked 4 plus years in my current position for state of SC and state rules say you ca n't maintain job and have a default loan. So now I 'm without employment and there is no check to garnish but now my children and I may soon be on the streets. 5. I am very much a responsible borrower. I pay on time and never missed it. This company is not helping students to help pay for student loans. The interest rate keeps increasing after transferring from XXXX XXXX XXXX to AES. It keeps increasing ever since I got transferred to AES. Thiscompany is making people stressed more. I have never received more than 1 bill statement with Bank XXXX XXXX 's account. With AES aka "" XXXX XXXX '' company, I have received at least more than 2 statements monthly. MAKING PROFITS IS TRULY THEIR MISSION! It is totally NOT reliable. This company should NOT exist because they are merely making profits out of students who are responsible borrowers/new borrowers. Therefore, they do n't deserve any stars. 1 star because it was required! They deserve 0 STAR! This company should be XXXX XXXX XXXX! Or change it to "" XXXX XXXX! 6. This company is by far the worst Company I have ever had to deal with. They send threatening letters demanding you pay so much or else they will take further action. Will NOT work with you in arranging payments you can afford and will NOT defer your loans if you are still in school. Total rip off and you will be paying out the XXXX if you get a loan with this company. They need to be shut down for their practices.
