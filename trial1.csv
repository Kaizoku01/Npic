04-11-2021,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Himy name is XXXX XXXX. I have been married for 30 years ( this past XXXX ) and my awesome Wife and I have XXXX amazing children. 

We have been in our current home for 21 years and we have raised all of our children in it. XXXX of our children were actually XXXX in this home. 

My Wife and I have experienced many financial setbacks due to COVID-19. The XXXX that I was a XXXX of closed its doors due to Covid and the XXXX position that my Wife enjoyed ended due to the death of her client, both in XXXX of XXXX. My Wife, XXXX of our children and I also had XXXX in XXXX and were down for the count for about a month in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Like a lot of other families, it has been very challenging to keep a sense of security for our children. 

My Wife and I are both now gainfully employed, and are playing catch up in life. We love our home and are really trying to keep our family in it. 

Our mortgage servicer, Select Portfolio Serving Inc. has grossly mishandled our situation, in our opinion. 

In XXXX of XXXX we reached out to said mortgage service provider ( SPS ) and explained our plight. We asked for a mortgage modification to lower our payment so that we could afford to stay in our home. On XX/XX/XXXX they came back with ONE option, a Repayment Plan which consisted of making new payments of {$4500.00}. I immediately called them to explain that we could not possibly afford these new payments especially when we could not make our regular sized payments of {$2200.00}. 
The wonderful representative, XXXX, suggested that we file an Appeal to ask them to spread the repayment plan over 36 months to lower the payments to {$1500.00} per month. She was kind enough to walk me thru the exact steps on where to go on there website and exactly what to say. This was a real blessing to us to get this great advice. Upon the conclusion of my call with XXXX, I immediately followed her steps to file an appeal and wrote it exactly as she had suggested, verbatim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, SPS acknowledged that they had received my appeal. I assumed they were considering it and my family and I waited for their response. There was no response. 

In the past, I had been told that my point of contact, the gentleman that is in charge of our situation, is a rep named XXXX XXXX. I left Mr. XXXX eight detailed voicemails as to our ongoing situation and asked if he would please contact us as soon as possible so we knew what to do. We lived in constant fear that the XXXX Sheriff would be pulling up to the house to serve us foreclosure papers. I was an extremely difficult period of uncertainty. 

I continued to keep checking our appeal status on the SPS website every other day and it continually said it was being Processed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX again and opted out of the dial your reps extension now and I spoke to a rep named XXXX. 
She acknowledged that they had indeed received my appeal, and they they indeed had NOT responded. She told me that they do NOT respond to appeals on Repayment Programs, ever. I told her how I had spoken with the rep named XXXX, and that XXXX was the one that suggested that I file an appeal, told me exactly what to say and guided me right thru the process on their website. 

XXXX, the rep that told me they Never negotiate repayment plans said that our new payment is {$4500.00}, it is NON NEGOTIABLE and that our first payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We are at our wits end and very fearful of looming news that we will be in foreclosure. 

Could you please help us keep our home? 
We are really trying to make this right and stay in our home of 21 years. 

Thank you in advance, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",FL,34240,,Consent provided,Web,04-11-2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,1657007
16-03-2022,Debt collection,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Hello! 

XXXX XXXX has been trying to collect a debt from me fraudulently for almost 18 months now. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX In 2020 I was issued a XXXX machine for medical treatment on an insurance payment plan that required compliance with the treatment in order for insurance to continue to pay. I agreed to this plan. I remained compliant for the ENTIRE payment period and treatment plan however they claim I have not remained compliant because their system has no records for my XXXX machine ( which I believe wirelessly uploads data cellularly ). As a result they have been trying to charge me {$210.00} since XX/XX/2020. 

The specific amounts owed are : {$100.00} for non-compliance in XXXX of 2020 {$100.00} for non-compliance in XXXX of 2020 I have attached proof of my compliance AND my communications with the previous debt collector. 

I have called XXXX a half dozen times about these invalid charges, and 2 different times faxed them proof of my treatment compliance from my local XXXX store. They continue to claim they've never received proof of compliance and thus continue to attempt to collect. 

Eventually I was sent to collections and I sent them also proof of my compliance ( also attached ). This debt collector stopped contacted me and I assumed it was fixed. Today I received a new debt collection request from a new debt collector, so the issue isn't stopping. The new debt collector is ARStrat ( XXXX ). 

I would like your help stopping their fraudulent claims please! I do not owe them any money and would appreciate your help proving this fact.",,Patient Accounting Service Center,FL,32207,,Consent provided,Web,16-03-2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5069898

I said "" yes '' - and requested an additional card for my daughter ( to use in case of emergency ). I received the cards then my daughter comes to me shortly thereafter and said that her credit score dropped almost XXXX points due to this Chase credit card. I was not sure how this could happen, as they did not have her permission, nor her social security number. I called Chase. They were not helpful and just said that it 's part of their process and it 's on their website that any other user 's information will be used. So I went back to the website and printed off the documentation - and did NOT find such info. Chase also put me through to the credit bureau they use ( I do n't recall which but seems maybe like XXXX ). I asked how they obtained my daughter 's permission and SS number to run her credit. They proceeded to tell me that they matched her name with my address and located her information in their database. Needless to say, this appears to be a privacy issue, at the very least. My daughter is trying to buy a home in the next year, and this does not help her FICO score! With Chase nor the credit bureau willing to help, I feel my only option is to file this complaint with your agency.

I spoke to a gentleman there, agreed on a payment date and made the payment on that date which he promised would keep me current and work for the re-fi. They still cancelled the re-fi and told me they could not see the notes the care agent entered. I told them this was not fair and that it is not my fault they have a technology problem.
